# Banking application

The coding challenge task is to create a backend for a simple "banking" application:
* Client should be able to sign up with email & password
* Client should be able to deposit money
* Client should be able to withdraw money
* Client should be able to see the account balance and statement

You should create the database structure, backend and REST API.

Technology stack (preferred, but free to use your own)

* Java 8
* Spring Boot
* PostgreSQL or any in-memory database (like H2/HSQLDB)
* Maven or Gradle as build system
* Host your code on GitHub/Bitbucket/GitLab public repo

Note: Spring security usage is not necessary.

What we will take into consideration on final valuation:

- How well business requirements are understood and implemented
- Quality of the code (design, legibility, validations)
- Test coverage
- Use of Java 8 features
